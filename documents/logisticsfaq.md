# Bellairs workshop on Sequential Decision-Making with Large Language Models

 ## Frequently asked questions

 Updated: December 20, 2022

 1. Requirements to enter Barbados: The most reliable source of information is [here](https://www.visitbarbados.org/plan-your-trip/travel-information). Most countries do not require a visa to visit Barbados, but be sure to check [here](https://www.visitbarbados.org/plan-your-trip/visa-and-entry-requirements). Note that since September 22, 2022, Barbados has discontinued all COVID-19 related travel protocols.
 
 2. Airport arrival: Do you need a cab? We would be happy to arrange your transportation from the airport to Bellairs -- our trusty driver Prince Butcher is available to transport participants when they arrive at BGI, based on their flight numbers indicated in the arrival spreadsheet (he  will be waiting at the airport arrivals exit). **IMPORTANT**: If you would like to opt-in to arranged transportation, please indicate it in the  "Taxi BGI-->Bellairs" column in the [arrival document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QA2DjGqfO_7okaDuCprp01LsFhW_vr3Az-Wmz27a9b0/edit?usp=sharing) no later than October 27th. You also have the option to pick a taxi outside of the baggage claim area at BGI airport. If the  driver does not know where the Bellairs institute is (they usually do), tell them it is beside Folkestone Marine Park in Holetown. In all cases, please bring enough USD or BBD to pay for the trip. 
 
 3.  What should I bring with me? In terms of clothing, you should take into consideration that the lecture hall is outdoors and that the weather will be quite hot. Do not forget to bring your bathing suit, beach towel, and snorkeling equipment since Bellairs is located right in front of a coral reef. You should also bring soap, shampoo, sunscreen, and mosquito repellant.
 
 4. Currency: The local currency is the Barbadian Dollar (BBD), but you can pay in USD everywhere (1 USD = 2 BBD).
 
 5. Accommodation: what to expect? The Bellairs research institute is located right on the beach in the Folkestone Marine Park. The facilities are basic but comfortable and the beach is right outside the door. Based on the number of rooms available, some participants will need to be paired. To get a sense of the premises, take a look at these pictures from last year: (https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~denis/barbados2022/#photo-gallery).
 
 6. Arriving at Bellairs: The premises are protected by a gate for which you will receive the password a few days in advance. Once you arrive, you will find your room assignments and get the key from a key box for which we will also communicate a password a few days in  advance. **IMPORTANT**: if you arrive or depart outside of the November 3-10 dates, you must contact Bellairs to check if this is possible, as we cannot guarantee availability outside the dates assigned to our group. 
 
 7. Scientific program: Thanks to all who volunteered to give lectures. The scientific program will run from Saturday, November 4 to Thursday, November 9. Each day will consist of two sessions: morning lectures (9:30 am - 12 pm) and evening open problem sessions (7 pm -  9:30 pm). The daily schedule can be found [here](TODO).
 
 8. Meals: Buffet-style meals will be available every day for breakfast and dinner. You will be charged for these according to the number of nights you spend at Bellairs. Lunch is on your own. There are plenty of options nearby and we usually walk somewhere as a group.
